# LinkedIn-Link-Capture
This project captures and prints all available hyperlink texts from a LinkedIn profile page using Selenium WebDriver in Java. It applies implicit waits to handle dynamic loading before extracting the &lt;a> tags. The script counts the total number of links and displays their visible text.
